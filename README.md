# About

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social interactions were significantly reduced, resulting in mental wellness becoming one of the world's key focuses. MentalStop is a one-stop online resource that harnesses the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence to help youths with mental health conditions take charge of their mood, and provides a platform for the general public to gain awareness of mental health conditions.

As a testament to MentalStop's significant positive impact on the general community, it won the Distinction Award at the IMDA DigitalForLife Youth Awards in 2022.
